Today I started with APIs and JSON.
Will keep on updating this file as and when I learn something new and interesting about them.
Will be adding on new codes and projects whenever I get time to create something fun with APIs and JS.

The first example here, I have used the swapi API to get the practicality of APIs and JSON works.
To understand how requests were sent originally, I have used XMLHttpsRequests method in JS.
It sure is a lot of code.

APIs

Application programming interfaces, or APIs, simplify software development and innovation 
by enabling applications to exchange data and functionality easily and securely.

A Web API is a developer's dream.
Because,
a. It can extend the functionality of the browser
b. It can greatly simplify complex functions
c. It can provide easy syntax to complex code

JSON

What is JSON?
JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation.
It is a format for sending data, that is consistent and predictable.
To put it more formally:
It is a lightweight data-interchange format
It is plain text written in JavaScript object notation
It is used to send data between computers
Most importantly it is language independent
